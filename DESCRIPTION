The test has similar type-I error rates and power as     the chi-square test. However, it is based on a total statistic that can be     decomposed additively into interaction effects, main effects, simple effects,     contrast effects, etc., mimicking precisely the logic of ANOVAs. We call     this set of tools ``ANOFA'' (Analysis of Frequency data) to highlight its     similarities with ANOVA. This framework also renders plots of frequencies     along with confidence intervals. Finally, effect sizes and planning statistical     power are easily done under this framework. The ANOFA is a tool that assesses     the significance of effects instead of the significance of parameters; as such,     it is more intuitive to most researchers than alternative approaches based on     generalized linear models.     See Laurencelle and Cousineau (2023) <doi:10.20982/tqmp.19.2.p173>.License: GPL-3Encoding: UTF-8VignetteBuilder: knitrLazyData: trueRoxygenNote: 7.2.3Depends:    R (>= 3.5.0)Imports:     rrapply (>= 1.2.6),    superb (>= 0.95.0),    Rdpack (>= 0.7),    ggplot2 (>= 3.1.0),    stats,    utilsSuggests:     rmarkdown,    testthat,    knitrRdMacros: Rdpack
